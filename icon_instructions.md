## Icon file

This is a placeholder for the icon file. Create a proper .ico file for the application.

For now, the application will work without an icon or can use a default one.

To create a proper icon:
1. Design a square logo (e.g., 256x256 pixels)
2. Convert it to .ico format using an online converter
3. Place the file as "icon.ico" in the AGENTSCRAP folder
